            <p>I completed my primary and secondary education at Belgrano School in the city of Salta. After finishing school, I worked informally in bars and businesses until I had the opportunity to go study. So far, I have been working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap as part of the bootcamp in which I am currently enrolled. However, I am improving my skills and expanding my knowledge to be able to provide a more comprehensive service.</p>

            <p>I believe in the connection between a healthy mind and a healthy body, which is why I dedicate two hours of each day to training and strive to take care of my nutrition to the fullest.</p>
            <p>If you want to know more or if you are looking for someone dedicated as a developer, do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
